<p>Digital electronics is the interface between computer science and electrical 
  engineering. In fact, it can be considered the core of computer engineering, 
  which is a college major offered at many universities. Digital electronics is 
  very closely related to the study of Boolean Algebra an duses most of the same 
  operators. However digital electronics focuses on schematic diagrams that indicate 
  the physical design of circuits. </p>

<p>Study the symbols and operators and apply the Boolean logic operations correctly.</p>
